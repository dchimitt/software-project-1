This repo contains a group project for the Software Engineering course at Purdue University Northwest. Its goal is to teach students how to use and collaborate on projects using GitHub.

Each student will be responsible for uploading an assigned algorithm to their test branch. All students will then gain experience in creating pull requests and accepting merges.
